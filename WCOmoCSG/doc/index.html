    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry"
    	target='other' title='wiki'>Constructive solid geometry (CSG)</a>
    <i>(formerly called computational binary solid geometry)</i> is a 
 	technique used in 3D solid modeling. Constructive solid geometry allows a modeler to create 
 	a complex surface or object by using Boolean operators to combine objects. Often CSG presents 
 	a model or surface that appears visually complex, but is actually little more than cleverly 
 	combined or decombined objects</p>
 	
 	<p>It is said that an object is constructed from primitives by means of allowable operations, which 
 	are typically Boolean operations on sets: union, intersection and difference.</p>
 	<ul>
 	<li>Union - the merger (addition) of two objects into one</li>
 	<li>Intersection - the portion common to both objects</li>
 	<li>Difference - what is left when you remove one object from another</li>
 	</ul>
 	
 	<h3 id="history">A Few Personal Notes on the History of this Code <i>(Q1 2015)</i></h3>
 	<p>After retiring from the professional life of a software engineer for over four decades, I have the
 	opportunity to indulge in a few whims and can now investigate things like 3D graphics. Having 
 	experimented with Java since its initial release in 1995, and having been developing enterprise-level,
 	commercial java applications since before 2000, <i>jMonkey</i> struck me as perfect place to begin
 	playing around.</p>
 	
 	<p>As an engineer, not a graphics designer, the idea of hand-tooling meshes and textures via various
 	UI oriented drawing tools has no appeal.  I am a build-it-up-programmatically kind of person. So
 	when I went looking for the concept of blending shapes together, I came across CSG and
 	a sample implementation in Java for <i>jMonkey</i>.</p>
 	
 	<p>As far as I can tell, <b>Evan Wallace</b> put together a Javascript library for CSG support within 
 	browsers that support WebGL. The underlying processing algorithm is BSP - Binary Space Partitioning
 	<br>@see <a href="http://evanw.github.io/csg.js" target='other' title='Evan Wallace BSP'
 	>http://evanw.github.io/csg.js</a> (it is really quite impressive).
 	<br>This was converted into <i>jMonkey</i> compatible Java by <b>fabsterpal</b>, and posted to a 
 	<a href="https://github.com/andychase/fabian-csg" target='other' title='fabsterpal github'>Github repository</a>
 	by <b>andychase</b>.  Everything seems to have been properly posted and annotated for fully open 
 	source.</p>
 	
 	<p>While working with the java code, I tripped over some bugs and encountered many spots
 	where I wished for more extensive comments.  My personal learning style is to work from an
 	operational example.  From there, I can make small, incremental changes to help me understand
 	the larger picture.  To that end, I reimplemented the Java code, following my own
 	conventions and structures.
 	<br>But the logic and algorithms are all based directly on what I found
 	in the original Javascript/Java code.</p>
 	
 	<p>Unfortunately, personal experience with this code, and further research on the web, lead me
 	to believe there is an inherent problem with BSP.  Due to the precision limitations on any
 	real computer, <i>artifacts</i> are introduced into more complex shapes. Therefore, I have
 	implemented a different algorithm based on the work of 
 	<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/unbboolean/" target='other' title='SourceForge UnbBoolean'
 	>Danilo Balby, Silva Castanheira</a>, who gratiously posted his work into the public domain.
 	
 	<p>In other words, I am frolicking in my sandbox...  But as a firm believer in open source, I am making my
 	experiments available to all.  If there is something here of value to you, feel free to use it.
 	I will be attempting to keep the posted code fully operational -- but for now, I am making no pledges
 	about backward compatibility.
 	<br>If you find a problem, post a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jmonkeycsg/tickets/"
 	target='other' title='SourceForge Tickes'>ticket</a>
 	 via SourceForge. </p>
 	 
 	<h3 id="structure">Code Structure</h3>
 	<p>I am attempting to retain the CSG code as an independent plug-in with no changes needed within
 	the jme3 core.  You will find the interesting stuff in the package "net.wcomohundro.jme3.csg".  Some
 	habits die hard (well, they really do not die at all), so I work within the Eclipse IDE tapping into
 	the jMonkey GIT SVN repository to provide the jMonkey environment. I have no real knowledge of the 
 	jMonkey IDE.</p>
 	<p>All that being said, I do have a set of core jme3 changes posted in the CSG SVN repository.
 	<i>(oh, come on, you just knew that was coming)</i> I have found the <b>Savable</b> support via XML
 	to be an excellent way to manage my test cases. My core code changes are mostly related to providing
 	reasonable (ie, non NullPointerException) defaults for elements missing from the XML. And I have
 	created a simple XMLLoader plugin for the AssetManager that allows me to load Assets from the 
 	XML files.  This allows me to create CSG test cases very simply by hand editing XML files. By 
 	providing reasonable defaults, I can prune my XML files to a bare minimum. At some future point, I will
 	be submitting my core changes back to the jMonkey project. They are handy for anyone who is interested
 	and the updates have no hard connections back into CSG.</p>
 	
 	<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
 	<ul>
 	<li>Primitive <i>shapes</i> based on any arbitrary Mesh</li>
 	<li>Composite geometry based on boolean blending of the shapes</li>
 	<li>Materials assigned to the <i>shape</i> apply to the surface generated by that shape in 
 	    the final geometry.  In other words, the result can have multiple Materials.</li>
 	<li>CSG specific primitive shapes support <i>surfaces</i> with different texture scaling
 	    applying to the different surfaces (ie, front, back, top, bottom, ...)</li>
 	</ul>
 	
 	<h3 id="elements">Basic Elements</h3>
 	<p>To use CSG, you will be working with <i>shapes</i> and <i>geometries</i>.</p>
 	<dl>
 	<dt>CSGShape</dt>
 	<dd>The basic CSG primitive based on any arbitrary Mesh.</dd>
  	<dt>CSGGeometry</dt>
 	<dd>The boolean blending point for the various CSGShapes which results in a final shape to
 	which a single Material is applied.</dd>
 	<dt>CSGGeonode</dt>
 	<dd>The boolean blending point for the various CSGShapes, each with it own optional material,
 	which results in a final shape.  The materials assigned to the primitives carry through 
 	into the surface that they produce in final result.  Primitives without an explicit material
 	use the material assigned to the CSGGeonode as a whole.</dd>
 	</dl>
 	<p>My original design intent was to define CSGGeometry for the blending point, with an ability
 	to support multiple materials.  As I learned more about jMonkey, I found that Geometry can
 	only readily support a single Mesh. To provide for multiple materials that bleed through from
 	the primitives, you really need to leverage a Node with Geometry children.  Therefore, 
 	CSGGeonode was created.  Multiple meshes are produced corresponding to the different materials.
 	CSGGeometry is no longer strictly required, since CSGGeonode provides all the same services.
 	But CSGGeometry does provide optimized processing for those objects that have a single material.</p>
 	
 	<h3 id="shapes">CSG Primitive Shapes</h3>
 	<p>CSGShape can be built from any mesh.  No further primitives other than those provided by
 	the core jMonkey services are required, and my original design intent was to <i>not</i> create
 	any CSG specific primitives.  But during the course of my testing, I tripped over issues around
 	textures for Box, Cylinder, and Sphere.  Therefore, I have created some CSG primitives.</p>
 	<p>The CSG primitives try to take a unified approach to their definition. This includes the idea
 	of shapes produced by multiple slices taken along the z-axis. And retaining the concept of a 
 	<i>surface</i> (front, back, top, bottom, ...), where the texture on each surface may be 
 	independently scaled.
 	<ul> 
 	<li>For a <b>CSGBox</b>, this means that a single repeating texture can be appropriately 
 	scaled to remain undistorted for any elongated edge.</li>
 	<li>For a <b>CSGCylinder</b>, the closed end caps are not radially distorted, but simply 
 	represent a circular cutout of the texture, which can be independently scaled.</li>
 	<li>For a <b>CSGSphere</b>, there is currently no special definition of a surface.</li>
 	</ul>
 	</p>
 	<p>Other enhancements include:
 	<ul>
 	<li>The radial distortion of the texture at the Sphere's poles has been eliminated.</li>
 	<li>You can choose to run the curved surface texture of a Cylinder along the height, rather
 		than along the circumference.</li>
 	<li>An x/y scale can be applied to every individual slice along the z-axis.</li>
 	<li>A rotation can be applied to every individual slice around the z-axis.  This results
 		in a twisted final shape.</li>
 	<li>A simple Spline generator that can easily produce a torus or a helix. </li>
 	<li>LOD processing is supported by reducing the number of slices by a given percentage. 
 	<br>A future enhancement is to reduce the number of radial points as well.</li>
 	<li>TangentBinormal generation can be triggered by a setting in the XML Savable file.</li>
 	</ul>
 	</p>

    <h3 id='download'>Download/Access the Code</h3>
    <p>
        jMonkeyCSG is managed via a SourceForge project which you can reference 
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmonkeycsg/" target='other'
        title='SourceForge Project'>here</a>. The .jar and .zip files can be 
        downloaded from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmonkeycsg/files/" target='other'
        title='SourceForge Download Files'>here</a>. 
        All source is available via the SourceForge 
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jmonkeycsg/code/HEAD/tree/" target='other'
        title='SourceForge Repository'>SVN repository</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h3 id='jme3ide'>The jMonkey IDE</h3>
    <p>As I stated earlier, I work in Eclipse, referencing the jme3 source in the main trunk 
    of the GitHub repository.  This means I am working with the latest jme3 code.
    I am not familiar with the jMonkey IDE and how to incorporate updates to the core code.
    So I have provided a CSG .jar file that contains all of my code, and a jMonkey .jar file
    that contains the trunk jme3 code that I use in Eclipse.  I have gotten the following 
    to work:</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>Pull down the CSG and jMonkey .jar files from the SourceForge <i>files</i> area.</li>
    	<li>Create a new project in the jMonkey IDE.</li>
    	<li>In the <i>Libraries</i> section of the project, use <b>Add Jar</b> to include
the jars you have downloaded.</li>
		<li>Be sure these new jars are at the bottom of the list.  That way you will be
referencing only those components needed to run your test.</li>
		<li>Modify you application initialization to include something like the examples below.</li>
    </ol> 
    <p>This will allow you run the CSG process via direct program references.  However, you 
	will be missing the core changes needed to support the .xml import mechanism.
<br>For standalone style testing (that does support .xml import), I have also provided a Windows(64bit) zip 
	file that contains everything needed to run a simple test.</p>
    
    <h3 id='start'>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>The simplest example is to add some shapes into a geometry, regenerate that geometry
    and apply a Material, and add the geometry into your scene.</p>
    <code><pre>       
    	// Blend shapes into a geometry
    	CSGGeometry aGeometry = new CSGGeometry();
    	aGeometry.setMaterial( new Material( assetManager, "Common/MatDefs/Misc/ShowNormals.j3md" ) );

    	// Start with a sphere
    	CSGShape aSphere = new CSGShape( "Sphere1", new Sphere( 32, 32, 1.3f ) );
    	aGeometry.addShape( aSphere, CSGGeometry.CSGOperator.UNION );

    	// Subtract out a cube
    	CSGShape aCube = new CSGShape( "Box", new Box(1,1,1) );
    	aGeometry.addShape( aCube, CSGGeometry.CSGOperator.DIFFERENCE );
    	
    	// Produce the final shape
    	aGeometry.regenerate();
    	
    	// Now add aGeometry to your scene
    </pre></code>
    <p>If you want to apply materials to the primitives, and have those materials appear
    on the appropriate surfaces in the final result, do something like the following.</p>
    <code><pre>
    	// Blend shapes into a geonode with an overall material
    	CSGGeonode aGeometry = new CSGGeonode();
    	aGeometry.setMaterial( new Material( assetManager, "Common/MatDefs/Misc/ShowNormals.j3md" ) );

    	// Start with a cube
    	CSGShape aCube = new CSGShape( "Box", new Box(1,1,1) );
    	aGeometry.addShape( aCube, CSGGeonode.CSGOperator.UNION );

    	// Subtract out a colored cylinder
    	CSGShape aCylinder = new CSGShape( "Cylinder", new Cylinder( 32, 32, 1.1f, pLength, true ) );
    	Material mat1 = new Material( assetManager, "Common/MatDefs/Misc/Unshaded.j3md" );
    	mat1.setColor( "Color", ColorRGBA.Yellow );
        aCylinder.setMaterial( mat1 );

    	aGeometry.addShape( aCylinder, CSGGeonode.CSGOperator.DIFFERENCE );
    	
    	// Produce the final shape
    	aGeometry.regenerate();
    	
    	// Now add aGeometry to your scene
    </pre></code>
    <h3>Test Cases</h3>
    <p>Various test cases are included in the SVN repository, all based on the Savable XML format. For
    example, a <i>corridor</i> can be created by subtracting a cylinder from an elongated box, and then
    cutting out a doorway.  As you can see, it is quite easy to build up complex examples very 
    quickly by editing the XML file.</p>
