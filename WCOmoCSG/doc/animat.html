 	<h3 id="animation">Animation</h3>
 	<p>Support for animation based on dynamic CSG processing is not one of my design goals. 
 I always anticipated severe performance hits due to matching all the surfaces in one shape 
 against all the surfaces in some other set of shapes.  I expected to use CSG as a loading 
 operation, absorbing the performance cost as part of initial setup.  If animation was desired, 
 I assumed that some N number of frames would be pre-built.</p>
 	<p>But it is still a fun test to see just what CSG can do dynamically. A rather simple
 test case is to have two shapes with a common center rotating in opposite directions. Then 
 display the intersection of the two. With simple boxes (12 triangles per box), you get 
 pretty good response.  Change one of those boxes to a somewhat smooth cylinder, and the
 frame rate takes a hit. You can interrogate the blended shape after regeneration to get
 a count of nanoseconds required to build the shape.</p>
 	<p>The setup is straight forward.  Create two shapes and blend them into a third. In the
 update loop, apply rotation to the two primitives, and then regenerate the blended shape. 
 The CSG code will rebuild the blend from scratch on every regenerate call.

 to the recording being active, but which is rather smooth in real life)</p>
 
  	<h3 id="progressive">Progressive Rebuild</h3>
 	<p>A more practical form of semi-automation is applying progressive changes to a 
 single target shape.  These changes could be triggered by user action, or could be
 continuous, moving at whatever rate the underlying hardware can provide.  CSG is
 structured to allow you to easily implement progressive changes.  The key is that
 the return of the <i>.regenerate()</i> call is a CSGShape.  This shape is the single
 result of the prior blend, and is ready for use.</p>
 	<p>A typical design pattern is to save the result of the initial .regenerate() in
 a 'priorResult' variable.  The update action is to first remove all shapes from your
 target, blend in the priorResult, blend in any new changes, and then save the result
 of this new .regenerate() back into priorResult.  This update loop can be run repetitively,
 incorporating whatever new changes are desired in each loop.</p>
 	<p>For example, CSGTestM starts with a cubic block of 'cheese'.  The update loop is to
 randomly move a spherical 'mouse' within a single quadrant of the block, and then subtract
 the sphere from the cube.  The result becomes the next starting point, so as the loop 
 continues, more and more of cheese is gnawed away by the mouse. While not smooth enough
 for true animation, it is still an effective display.

 	<h3 id="threads">Multi-threading</h3>
 	<p>To better support animation and progressive rebuild, the CSG construction process
 has been made <i>thread aware</i>.
