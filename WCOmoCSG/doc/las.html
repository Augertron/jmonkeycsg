    <p>I began my efforts with CSG to fulfill a need for programmatic construction tools that 
I can leverage in other experiments.  To that end, the CSG support has grown somewhat beyond
the minimal needs of adding/subtracting/intersecting shapes.  The following are just some of
the features implemented to meet my other personal requirements.</p>

    <h3 id='lights'>Lights</h3>
	<p>I had not anticipated any use for Lights being locally attached to the primitive shapes
that are being blended together.  No provision was made for them in the original code, and
such lights were blissfully ignored.  But I started working more with <i>interior</i> spaces
that result from subtracting a smaller object from the middle of a larger one.  I know that
globally acting lights affect all surfaces equally, with no particular knowledge of an interior
space.  To get the proper illumination of an enclosed/interior space, <i>shadow</i> processing
must be turned on.</p>

	<p>The core jMonkey engine supports shadow processing via Renderers/Filters that are
tied to specific kind of lights. But my experiments yielded less-than-inspiring results.  Some
of the effects were quite realistic, but there were many instances of just plain oddness. 
And the frame rate dropped precipitously. I am willing to attribute many issues to my lack of
understanding, but until I can access better examples, I need a different approach.</p>

	<p>Since local lights apply only to those elements within the given Spatial, I realized that
I can produce some level of interior-only lighting if I could create an appropriate Node as part
of the blending process. Support for multiple Materials already knows how to associate an end-product
surface back to its original primitive shape.  This procedure was readily expanded to keep track
of local lights as well as materials.  The end result includes a Node that contains the local
lights, and all the surface Mesh elements that are illuminated by such lights.</p>

	<p>For example, if I subtract a cylinder from a box, I can define lights on the cylinder itself.
These lights only appear on the final interior surfaces elements, no where else.  While certainly
not a comprehensive solution as true shadows would be, this allows me to produce some nice effects. 
This also works well with groups of subshapes.  To create an arch-shaped corridor, I group together
a half-height Box for the bottom, and a Cylinder for the top.  I can then subtract this group 
from an exterior Box.  Adding lights to the group results in some nice interior illumination.
Adding lights locally to the exterior box means I can light the outside without bleed-through
into the interior.<p>

	<p>The default jme3 behavior is that all lights are positioned in world space, even if locally
defined. The goal of CSG is to build up a complex shape from simpler primitives. When lights are 
added, one would expect that transforming the final shape would retain the proper illumination.
But if lights are positioned globally, translating the final shape means the lights are no longer
shining where one would expect.  jme3 addresses this issue via the LightControl, which can 
reposition a Light as its associated Spatial is transformed.  By default, CSG will create and 
assign an appropriate Control to all local lights encountered during a blend.  It uses a custom
CSGLightControl that better supports the underlying CSG structure.  But you can disable this
feature or provide any other Control to use for light management.</p>

    <h3 id='physics'>Physics</h3>
	<p>In a fashion very similar to Lights, I had not foreseen the need for Physics processing
being an integral part of CSG.  But as I worked through more tests, I hit the requirement to
define Physics at the primitive level, rather than trying to add it back in externally.  All 
in all, it is much easier to add Physics definitions via XML at the proper level, and then 
have the system take care of it all for you.</p>
	<p>To this end, Physics are added much like lights.  Physics applies only to the segment
of the final mesh appropriate to the blended primitive. So if you are creating a <i>room</i>
by subtacting a small box from a bigger box, and you want bouncy walls but an inert floor, you 
can apply different, per-face physics to the different surfaces.  The final blend keeps it
all straight for you.</p>
	
 	<h3 id="surfaces">2D Surfaces</h3>
 	<p>The main thrust of CSG is the blending of solids.  But I ran into the situation of 
 wanting to place a solid on my 2D floor without the floor bleeding through.  There is certainly 
 no need to build the floor as a solid, and I was hoping to leverage the jme3 Surface and Terrain.  
 The IOB processor does a fine job of detecting overlaps and selecting the proper triangles for
 the final blended shape.  Subtracting the solid from the floor gives me a nice hole where the
 solid should go.  Intersecting the solid and the floor shows me exactly where the overlap is.
 And a union gives me a funky shape that I am not sure is very useful (but which looks correct).
 </p>
 	<p>I have no idea if the BSP processor will function properly, and I have no plans to
 experiment or work on it.</p>
