    <h1><i>jMonkey</i> <em>CSG - Constructive Solid Geometry</em></h1>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry">Constructive solid geometry (CSG)</a>
    <i>(formerly called computational binary solid geometry)</i> is a 
 	technique used in 3D solid modeling. Constructive solid geometry allows a modeler to create 
 	a complex surface or object by using Boolean operators to combine objects. Often CSG presents 
 	a model or surface that appears visually complex, but is actually little more than cleverly 
 	combined or decombined objects</p>
 	
 	<p>It is said that an object is constructed from primitives by means of allowable operations, which 
 	are typically Boolean operations on sets: union, intersection and difference.</p>
 	<ul>
 	<li>Union - the merger (addition) of two objects into one</li>
 	<li>Intersection - the portion common to both objects</li>
 	<li>Difference - what is left when you remove one object from another</li>
 	</ul>
 	
 	<h3>A Few Personal Notes on the History of this Code <i>(2015)</i></h3>
 	<p>After retiring from the professional life of a software engineer for over four decades, I have the
 	opportunity to indulge in a few whims and can now investigate things like 3D graphics. Having 
 	experimented with Java since its initial release in 1995, and having been developing enterprise-level,
 	commercial java applications since before 2000, <i>jMonkey</i> struck me as perfect place to begin
 	playing around.</p>
 	
 	<p>As an engineer, not a graphics designer, the idea of hand-tooling meshes and textures via various
 	UI oriented drawing tools has no appeal.  I am a build-it-up-programmatically kind of person. So
 	when I went looking for the concept of blending shapes together, I came across CSG and
 	a sample implementation in Java for <i>jMonkey</i>.</p>
 	
 	<p>As far as I can tell, <i>Evan Wallace</i> put together a Javascript library for CSG support within 
 	browsers that support WebGL.  @see <a href="http://evanw.github.io/csg.js">http://evanw.github.io/csg.js</a>
 	 (it is really quite impressive).
 	<br>This was converted into jMonkey compatible Java by <i>fabsterpal</i>, and posted to a 
 	<a href="https://github.com/andychase/fabian-csg">Github repository</a>
 	by <i>andychase</i>.  Everything seems to have been properly posted and annotated for fully open 
 	source.</p>
 	
 	<p>While working with the <i>fabsterpal</i> code, I tripped over some bugs and encountered many spots
 	where I wished for more extensive comments.  My personal learning style is to work from an
 	operational example.  From there, I can make small, incremental changes to help we understand
 	the larger picture.  To that end, I reimplemented the Java code, following my own
 	conventions and structures.  But the logic and algorithms are all based directly on what I found
 	in the original Javascript/Java code.</p>
 	
 	<p>In other words, I am frolicking in my sandbox...  But as a firm believer in open source, I am making my
 	experiments available to all.  If there is something here of value to you, feel free to use it.
 	I will be attempting to keep the posted code fully operational -- but for now, I am making no pledges
 	about backward compatibility.
 	<br>If you find a problem, post a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jmonkeycsg/tickets/">ticket</a>
 	 via SourceForge. </p>
 	 
 	<h3>Code Structure</h3>
 	<p>I am attempting to retain the CSG code as an independent plug-in with no changes needed within
 	the jme3 core.  You will find the interesting stuff in the package "net.wcomohundro.jme3.csg".  Some
 	habits die hard (well, they really do not die at all), so I work within the Eclipse IDE tapping into
 	the jMonkey GIT SVN repository to provide the jMonkey environment. I have no real knowledge of the 
 	jMonkey IDE.</p>
 	<p>All that being said, I do have a set of core jme3 changes posted in the CSG SVN repository.
 	<i>(oh, come on, you just knew that was coming)</i> I have found the <b>Savable</b> support via XML
 	to be an excellent way to manage my test cases. My core code changes are mostly related to providing
 	reasonable (ie, non NullPointerException) defaults for elements missing from the XML. And I have
 	created a simple XMLLoader plugin for the AssetManager that allows me to load Assets from the 
 	XML files.  This allows me to create CSG test cases very simply by hand editing XML files. By 
 	providing reasonable defaults, I can prune my XML files to a bare minimum. At some future point, I will
 	be submitting my core changes back to the jMonkey project. They are handy for anyone who is interested
 	and have no hard connections back into CSG.</p>
